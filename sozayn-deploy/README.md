# SoZayn Landing Page Updates

This package contains the updated landing page with aligned CTA buttons and order tracking visualization.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the CTA section with properly aligned buttons (lines 1091-1100):
   ```html
   <section id="support" class="cta-section">
     <div class="container">
       <h2 class="section-title">Ready to optimize your deliveries?</h2>
       <p>Get started with SoZayn today and transform how you handle order fulfillment.</p>
       <div class="cta-buttons" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto;">
         <a href="/auth" class="btn btn-primary" style="padding: 0.8rem 1.8rem; font-size: 1rem; flex: 1; min-width: 160px;">Create account</a>
         <a href="#support" class="btn btn-outline" style="padding: 0.8rem 1.8rem; font-size: 1rem; flex: 1; min-width: 160px;">Contact sales</a>
       </div>
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

2. Added Order Status visualization in the dashboard card (lines 290-336):
   - Shows 5 stages: Order Received, Processing, Dispatching, In Transit, Delivered
   - Progress bar at the "Dispatching" stage (75% complete)
   - Completed stages have checkmarks and active stage is highlighted

3. Made the "About" section shorter and more concise.
