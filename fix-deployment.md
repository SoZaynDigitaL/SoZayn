# SoZayn Digital Era - Deployment Fix

Follow these steps to fix the "frontend build is not available" issue in your Heroku deployment:

## Step 1: Build the Frontend Application

First, let's make sure you have a complete frontend build:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the root directory of your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Build the frontend
npm run build
```

This will create a complete `dist` directory with all the necessary JavaScript, CSS, and asset files.

## Step 2: Verify Build Output

Check that your `dist` directory contains the complete build. You should see:

```
dist/
├── assets/
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── [javascript files with hashes].js
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── [css files with hashes].css
│   └── [other asset files]
├── index.html
└── [other static files]
```

## Step 3: Prepare Deployment Package

Create a deployment package with all the necessary files:

1. Create a new directory for the deployment package:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p sozayn-deploy
   ```

2. Copy the complete build and server files:
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire dist directory
   cp -r dist sozayn-deploy/

   # Copy server files
   cp server.js sozayn-deploy/
   cp health-check.js sozayn-deploy/
   cp Procfile sozayn-deploy/
   cp package.json sozayn-deploy/
   cp app.json sozayn-deploy/
   ```

## Step 4: Deploy to Heroku

Once your deployment package is ready:

```bash
# Navigate to deployment directory
cd sozayn-deploy

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete deployment with frontend build"

# Connect to your Heroku app
heroku git:remote -a sozayndigital

# Deploy to Heroku
git push heroku main --force
```

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

After deployment, check:

1. Visit your app URL: https://sozayndigital.herokuapp.com
2. Run the health check: `heroku run node health-check.js`
3. Check logs: `heroku logs --tail`

## Common Issues

If you still face issues:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure your `package.json` includes all required dependencies.
2. **Build configuration**: Check that your Vite build is configured correctly.
3. **Static file path**: Verify the server is correctly serving static files from the `dist` directory.
4. **Environment variables**: Make sure all required environment variables are set on Heroku.
