# SoZayn Digital Era - Landing Page Update Instructions

I've created an updated landing page with the following changes:

1. **Made the "About" section shorter** - simplified the text to be clear and concise
2. **Enhanced the dashboard card** to clearly show order tracking status
3. **Fixed the CTA section alignment** - buttons are now properly aligned in the center with appropriate spacing
4. **Added "Welcome To Digital Era" subtitle** under the SoZayn logo

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy this updated landing page to your Heroku app:

1. Download the `sozayn-deployment.zip` file
2. Extract the contents to a directory on your local machine
3. Initialize Git in this directory:
   ```bash
   cd sozayn-deploy-update
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update landing page with properly aligned CTA"
   ```

4. Connect to your existing Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku git:remote -a sozayndigital-e2112b66b875
   ```

5. Push the updated code:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main --force
   ```

## Verifying the Deployment

After deploying, visit your Heroku app URL to verify the changes:

Key things to check:
- The dashboard card now clearly shows order tracking status
- The About section is shorter and more concise
- The CTA buttons in the "Ready to optimize your deliveries?" section are properly aligned
- The "Welcome To Digital Era" subtitle appears under the SoZayn logo

## If You Need to Revert

If anything goes wrong, you can revert to the previous version using the Heroku CLI:
```bash
heroku rollback
```

Or redeploy your previous working version.
